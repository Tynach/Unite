PLACEHOLDER.

Yes, this code is copyrighted. Or copylefted, rather. I'm currently license-hunting, but this is roughly what I want:

1.) Attribution: I want people to recognize that I created it.
2.) Same-license: I want derivatives to be under the same license.
3.) Modifiable: Should let anyone modify/distribute/use/whatever it freely, without having to ask me.
4.) It should be combinable with non-open source programs and/or services - for example, if a person creates a website with it, their website may be closed source, but any modifications they make to my framework should be made open source (under the same license).
5.) It should make it so that even hosting their site to the public means they need to distribute modifications - none of that "well it's in-house, only hosted on OUR servers, so we don't have to release it..." crap.
6.) Hopefully the FSF or OSI have approved it. But I don't care if they haven't.

So, yeah. Some of those points may or may not be subtracted, and I may add more later. I honestly don't know at this point.
