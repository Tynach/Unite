* Ratings - age ratings for how old someone should be to view content. G, PG, PG-13, R, XXX, that sort of thing. Users can customize which ones they can and can't see in search results and so forth, though they can't enable ratings above their age.

* Tags - Almost everything has tags, allowing for a *booru/e621 style search.

* Tag ratings - certain things should not be searched for by minors.

* Privileges - Everything can have privileges assigned to it.

* Private messages.

* Contact groups - Instead of a 'friend' system, the roleplay site uses a system similar to Google+ Circles. You group people you know or have come across, and you can put people in multiple groups. This lets you effectively categorize different roleplayers; either as 'friends' or 'enemies'; 'sci-fi lovers' or 'fantasy'; 'sexy' or 'prudes'... Anything you wish.

* Clubs - These are member-created personal OOC (Out Of Character) 'mini-forums'. People can go to as many clubs as they like. They're user-moderated, similar to Reddit. The creator of each club can give privileges to modify/delete other members' posts, choose who can join the club, and even who can view it.

* Characters - I didn't want to compete with F-list, so this isn't designed to show people's fetishes or likes/dislikes. This is simply designed for tagging and assigning images and descriptions to people's characters. Tags are searchable e621-style, as mentioned.

    One thing of note is that characters can use the privileges system to be lent to other roleplayers. Say a roleplayer will be gone for a while and can't roleplay, but other people want to continue the roleplay. People can then be given permission to use that character as if it were there own, sorta. This can be limited to a certain RP, or globally. People can even be given permission to edit the character.

    Characters can also belong to clubs, where the creator of the character can determine in what way different clubs can use the character.

* Universes - Universes are descriptions of the worlds and settings that roleplays take place in. I'm considering letting people pay money to have multi-page Universe descriptions (so that they can more easily link to, say, a certain planet or realm in their sci-fi or fantasy Universes, instead of having a big huge page; I'd kinda like to make money somehow off this site... I think $1/mo. or $10/yr. is reasonable; or perhaps $10 per extra page, and no recurring costs. I don't know). Universes can be tagged as well.

* Roleplays - These are similar to forum roleplays, except designed more around roleplaying. Roleplays are tagged and searchable. OOC (Out Of Character) and IC (In Character) posts are separate, users being capable of hiding one or the other to focus on either discussion of the roleplay or the roleplay itself. Roleplays can be open to the public, where anyone can join, or closed, to where you need to ask to join... Or just hidden, so only people you tell know about it. There is a queue for joining, which the owner/moderators can sift through to let certain people join, if the roleplay is not open. Either way, open or not, you have to specifically join before you can post in it - this lets the owners/moderators keep track of who is actually in the roleplay. If someone is not contributing, they can be kicked out/banned.

* Roleplay posts are assigned different characters, or multiple characters. This allows you to designate what characters are visible in what posts; so you can easily go back and see when the last time a character was used. This works similarly to tagging, except it only draws from the list of characters that the user posting has at their disposal (either by someone letting them use the character, or by them creating the character).

So far, I have yet to create moderator/privilege tables for Universes and Roleplays, but everything else is there. About 90% done.
